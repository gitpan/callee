NAME
    callee - support recursive anonymous functions

VERSION
    version 1.100820

SYNOPSIS
        use callee;

        my $f = sub {
            my $x = shift;
            return 1 if $x <= 1;
            $x * callee->($x-1);
        }->(5);

        # $f is 120

DESCRIPTION
    This module exports one function, "callee()", which allows anonymous
    functions to refer to themselves. This is necessary for recursive
    anonymous functions.

    A recursive function must be able to refer to itself. Typically, a
    function refers to itself by its name. However, an anonymous function
    does not have a name, and if there is no accessible variable referring
    to it, i.e. the function is not assigned to any variable, the function
    cannot refer to itself. This is where "callee" comes in.

    This module is just very thin syntactic sugar for Devel::Caller.

FUNCTIONS
  callee
    Returns a coderef to the function within which it is called.

SEE ALSO
    Takesako-san wrote "arguments.pm" - see
    <http://svn.coderepos.org/share/lang/perl/arguments/trunk/> - which does
    practically the same thing; see also his blog entry (in Japanese):
    <http://d.hatena.ne.jp/TAKESAKO/20080501/1209637452>.

    I released this module because "arguments.pm" is not on CPAN, and
    because Devel::Caller already existed on CPAN, but not with the syntax I
    wanted.
