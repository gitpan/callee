This is the Perl distribution callee.

This module exports one function, C<callee()>, which allows anonymous
functions to refer to themselves. This is necessary for recursive anonymous
functions. 

A recursive function must be able to refer to itself. Typically, a function
refers to itself by its name. However, an anonymous function does not have a
name, and if there is no accessible variable referring to it, i.e. the
function is not assigned to any variable, the function cannot refer to itself.
This is where callee comes in.

This module is just very thin syntactic sugar for L<Devel::Caller>.

INSTALLATION

callee installation is straightforward. If your CPAN shell is
set up, you should just be able to do

    % cpan callee

Download it, unpack it, then build it as per the usual:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make && make test

Then install it:

    % make install

DOCUMENTATION

callee documentation is available as in POD. So you can do:

    % perldoc callee

to read the documentation online with your favorite pager.
